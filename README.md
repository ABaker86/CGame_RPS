CGame_RPS
=========

A rock, paper, scissors game written for the console in C


This `text-based game` is a simplistic console based executable compiled with the MinGW (gcc) compiler.The code involves loops and branches to determine whether the user or (overly simplified) AI wins each hand. Win, loss, draw, and total hand counts are aggregated and printed to the bottom of the screen after each hand. Accumulated totals allow the user to have a sense of accomplishment.
